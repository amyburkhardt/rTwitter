6951	We must learn from how people treat students. People who care could be #protest or #optout but we should run from anyone who bullies kids.
6952	Think we need stats for accountability that's great! Much respect. DON'T deny SoC the same access to info that whites have. #optout
6953	Again that's whether you think we need ANY of the tests or not. Now with the 2nd or 3rd test that's an added layer. #optout
6954	To deny SoC access to info about their own rights is to support institutional racism. #optout
6955	I don't care if you are pro-overtesting or pro- #optout students and families should know their rights. Period.
6956	Wish I could say the same for pro-overtesting folks who limit the flow of info and punish students who choose differently. #optout
6957	I don't encourage my students to #optout even though that's what I think is best. I encourage them to speak with their families and decide.
