2222	Oh look it's a former student who exercised her own agency around testing RTing the whole thread. @joshcrosson #optout
2223	So if critique of union and educators' role in #optout is that it's self interested must also ask what's opposing motivation? @joshcrosson
2224	"By natural #optout I mean students and families receive full info about assessment and no incentive to take or not take"" @joshcrosson"""
2225	But let's take your original assumption. My experience is the natural #optout rate on #PARCC is 80-90% in CPS @joshcrosson
2226	In students led #optout situations the administration response has been typical #STPP response to Social voicing their rights. @joshcrosson
