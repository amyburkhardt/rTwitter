49279	@shreec @xianb8 @PARCCPlace I've raised issues at local & state BOE mtgs. But awful as #PARCC looks; narrowing curriculum is the real issue.
49280	@shreec @xianb8 @PARCCPlace Yes. I've written to #PARCC & gotten no answer. I've gone to newspaper & gotten apology from Pearson 4 an issue.
49281	@shreec Really? B/c we were given #PARCC aver & max times for each day by school district. E.g. 50 minutes aver/expected; 75 min max etc.
49282	@xianb8 @shreec @PARCCPlace That is true but a major (& I think valid) objection to #PARCC is develop. inappropriate for elementary.
